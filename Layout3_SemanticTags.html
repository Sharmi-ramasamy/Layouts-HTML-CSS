                <h3> What is Pongal? </h3>
                <p> Pongal is a harvest festival celebrated by the Tamil community. It is a celebration to thank the
                    Sun, Mother Nature and the various farm animals that help to contribute to a bountiful harvest.
                    Celebrated over four days, Pongal also marks the beginning of the Tamil month called Thai, which is
                    considered an auspicious month. It usually falls on the 14th or 15th of January each year.
                    Pongal is also the name of the dish made and eaten during this festival. It is a mixture of boiled
                    sweet rice. It is derived from the Tamil word pongu, which means “to boil over”. </p>

                <h3> <em> Pongal and Cattle Relation </em> </h3>
                <p> Legends say that Pongal celebration date back to Sangam age (200BC-200AD) and has found mention in
                    puranas. According to one of the legends associated with Pongal, Lord Shiva had a bull called Basava
                    who he sent on earth to spread the message that humans should have oil massage and bath every day
                    and eat once a month. Basava instead told humans to do the opposite - eat every day and take an oil
                    bath once a month. Punished by Lord Shiva, Basava was sent to earth to help humans by ploughing
                    their field and meet their daily food requirements. This is how cattle came to be associated with
                    Pongal.</p>
